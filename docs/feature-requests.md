# Feature Requests

This document tracks community requests and ideas for future HN-TUI releases.

## Active Requests

- Layout option with comments in the middle pane.
- Compact split view for small screens.
- Comment pane keyword search.
- Cleaner feed metadata presentation.
- Shortcut customization for non-QWERTY layouts.
- Add link yanking so numbered hints jump to external open actions.
- Support additional inline image protocols beyond kitty graphics.
- Restore optional clipboard copy for outbound links.
- Full-screen image view that temporarily fills the terminal for easier reading.
- Implement search using Algolia HN Search API.
- Add category filtering and custom story lists.
- Performance improvements for loading large comment threads.

## Completed Requests (from Reddix fork)

- Improved inline image handling so cramped terminals no longer overflow previews.
- Added inline Kitty/mpv video playback embedded directly in the post content.

## Not Applicable to HN-TUI

- Gallery support for multi-image posts (HN doesn't have galleries).
- Comment creation support (HN API is read-only without authentication).
- Save full-resolution videos (most HN posts are external links).

## Backlog Notes

- Move extra feed metadata into alternate panes.
- Add discovery tools like category browser, HN search (Algolia), external player hooks.
- Package for more distros such as Nix and Arch/AUR.
