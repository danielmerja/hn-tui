## Quickstart
1. Create a Reddit “script” at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and set the redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:65010/reddix/callback`.
2. Launch `reddix`, press `m`, and follow the guided menu for setup.
3. Prefer to configure things manually? Copy [`docs/examples/config.yaml`](docs/examples/config.yaml) into `~/.config/reddix/config.yaml` and fill in your credentials.

Core shortcuts: `j/k` move, `h/l` change panes, `m` guided menu, `o` action menu, `r` refresh, `s` sync subs, `u/d` vote, `q` quit.
